                <h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE AQUARIUS</h2>
                <p>
                    February was the eleventh month to be named in the calendar year. It was added by Numa
                    Pompilius about 713 BC and was the last month of the year until 450 BC when it was then 
                    moved to be the second month of the calendar year. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name 'February' comes from the Roman festival of purification called 'Februa'. During
                    this festival, people were ritually washed. It would interest you to know that February used 
                    to be called the 'cabbage month'. Perhaps, it was so called because the medieval English 
                    were eating lots of cabbage in February(!). 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="facts">
                <h2>DID YOU KNOW?</h2>
                <p>
                    Did you know that North Korea and Cuba are the only countries where you can't buy Coca Cola?
                    It's something that most people usually take for granted - that whereever you go, you could
                    always enjoy a bottle of Coke. Well, news alert! You can't enjoy one in North Korea or
                    Cuba.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is because these countries are under long-term U.S. trade embargoes. However, you might 
                    be able to snag a snip of the stuff if you try hard enough. Although, it will typically be
                    a lot more expensive than what you would ordinarily pay for it in other countries of the 
                    world and it would most probably be imported from a neighbouring country too.

            <h3>
                VARICOSE VEINS <br/>(SPIDER VEINS)
            </h3>
            <p>
                Not many of us, if any, would be familiar with varicose veins. Varicose veins which are also
                called varicoses or varicosities (healthline.com, 2019), are simply twisted and enlarged 
                veins which have been overfilled with blood and it can happen in superficial veins (i.e veins 
                near the surface of the skin) anywhere in the body but are more common in the legs 
                (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2023).
                This condition is brought about due to obstruction of blood flow, causing an inability of 
                the blood to flow effectively in the affected area(s). Blood travels in one direction in the 
                veins and loss of flexibility and/or elasticity due to stretching of the veins may cause the 
                valves of the veins to get weaker. This can cause blood to flow backwards in opposite
                direction. When this happens, blood can accumulate in vein(s) which then become enlarged and 
                swollen. Veins farthest from the heart, such as those in the legs, are the most often 
                affected ones. This is because gravity makes it harder for the blood to flow back to the 
                heart (MedicalNewsToday, 2022).
            </p>
            <p>It is very common, especially in women (healthline.com, 2019). An estimated 23% of adults are 
                thought to be affected by varicose veins and approximately 1 in 4 adults in the United States 
                suffer this condition (MedicalNewsToday, 2022).  However, Varicoses is not considered a 
                serious medical condition (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2023).
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Because it is not a serious medical condition, doctors are usually conservative when treating
                varicoses. Instead of undergoing more aggressive treatments, patients are rather encouraged 
                to make lifestyle changes like avoiding standing for extended periods of time, losing weight 
                or maintaining a healthy weight, exercising to improve blood circulation, use of compression 
                socks or stockings (healthline.com, 2019). However, if lifestyle changes are not working and 
                the patient is experiencing pain or needs the varicose veins to be removed for aesthetic 
                reasons, a surgery may be required (MedicalNewsToday, 2022).

                Do you know anyone who has varicoses? Sure you do but you may not have noticed or drawn a 
                conclusion to that person even with this article. Well, daddy has it on his right leg, I 
                think.

                <h3>MARCH HOME COMING</h3>
                <p>
                    It is with great pleasure that I bring to your notice the possibility of a full house
                    home coming in the month of March. Nothing is cast on stone yet but a tentative date (15th
                    of March) has been agreed upon by the parties involved and it is looking like we
                    will be having a full house around that time. Fingers crossed people!
                </p>
                <h3>CHRISTMAS HOME COMING</h3>
                <p>This is to bring to the notice of everyone that daddy has said that it is his earnest desire
                    that we all celebrate Christmas this year in the village. To this end, he has kindly 
                    requested that we should start making plans to travel to the village for Christmas 
                    celebrations this year. Please, take note of his plea. Thank you.
