            <h2>FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK</h2>
            <p>
                The month of February was wonderful. We marked two anniversaries and some of us voted
                for the very first time. No unfortunate incidences occured during the month and we can only 
                be grateful to God for all of this and more. So, as we begin a new month, it is my prayer that
                the month of March would be even better and more rewarding. Amen.
            </p>
            <p>
                An African adage says: "if you want to go fast, walk alone but if you want to go far, walk 
                together". Life is more of a marathon than a sprint and as such, the better approach should be
                going far instead of fast. Finding a team for this journey is even easier for us since we have
                one another. Our individual goals should be much easier to achieve when we work as a group with
                eyes on our collective goal - a family to be reckoned with. For those of us who can still recall
                way back in 2020 when we agreed to start pulling funds together, we were able to get a new van 
                for dad within the first quarter of 2021. That was one of the first proofs of what we can 
                achieve as a united group. We continued forging on and even came up with a 
                name for our own company, VERiNOM. It may have been out of an initial burst of enthusiasm which 
                to be honest has really watered down because barely two years on, a lot of us have relented and 
                some of us are even yet to join the train.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I am excited to state here that the vision is not dead but it will take sincere efforts
                from all of us to reignite that enthusiasm. Who says we can't own our own company together? I 
                know we all have dreams of our own but the idea of the VERiNOM group in itself is to marry all of 
                our dreams into one. The accomplishment of every individual dream would mean a step forward in
                accomplishing the VERiNOM dream. So, let's not hold back in working together as a team. Let every
                step we take be for the collective growth of this family. We can be more than we currently are. 
                I believe.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, to a much better approach from all of us, I give a hearty cheer! God bless us all. Amen.
            </p>

                <h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE PISCES</h2>
                <p>
                    March  was originally called Martius and used to be the first month of the earliest Roman 
                    calendar. The month is named after the Roman god of war, Mars. The month of March 
                    symbolically represents new growth, fertility, and procreation. This is because March is the 
                    time of the year when animals start waking up from hibernation and also because it is the 
                    beginning of Spring.

                    The oldest-known living land animal is a tortoise named Jonathan, which is about to turn
                    190 years old. He was born in 1832 and has lived on the Island of St Helena in the Atlantic

            <h3>FEED YOUR GUT BACTERIA</h3>
            <p>
                The bacteria in you gut, collectively called the gut microbiota, are incredibly important for 
                overall health. A disruption in gut bacteria is linked to some chronic diseases, including
                obesity and a myriad of digestive problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good ways to improve gut health include eating probiotic foods like yogurt and sauerkraut,
                taking probiotic supplements when indicated, and eating plenty of fiber. Notably, fiber serves
                as a prebiotic or a food source for your gut bacteria.

                    will be having a full house around that time. Fingers crossed people!
