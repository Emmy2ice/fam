            <h2>FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK</h2>
            <p>
                March came with some memorable events. It brought us a fair share of happy moments and afforded
                us some time to spend together. Indeed, the short reunion we managed to scuff out was not taken
                for granted in any way and we are grateful to him who showed us mercy. Could it have been better?
                Yes. Could it have been worse? Yes too! 
            </p>
            <p>
               As we begin the month of April, it is my sincere desire that we all continue to build on the 
               tenets that make up any successful family. We should continue to show pure commitment towards
               the growth of one another. We should understand that the actions of everyone of us directly
               impacts and imparts on the rest of us. I beg you all, this understanding is key towards ensuring 
               a true progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Management of resources for productive ventures should be a priority for all of us. We cannot 
                afford to continue spending on things that do not ensure our growth. We must be prudent and 
                calculative. We must seek reasonable alternatives before spending. We must not spend simply
                because we can. We must also try our best to contribute to the family account, no matter how 
                little. Together, these little efforts would turn out to have significant effects with time.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, to a much better approach from all of us, I give a hearty cheer as I welcome you all to the 
                second quarter of the year. God bless us all. Amen.
            </p>

                <h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE TAURUS</h2>
                <p>
                    April takes its name from the Latin word "aperire", which means "to open" (just like flowers
                    do in Spring). It was the second month in the ancient Roman calendar. In the old Roman 
                    calendar, April initially had 30 days. When January was introduced into the calendar, April
                    was cut down to 29 days. In the year 46 BCE, Julius Caesar introduced a new calendar system 
                    - the Julian calendar. He added ten days to the year and introduced the leap day. In the new
                    Julian calendar, April was then expanded back to 30 days. Taurus is represented by the head 
                    of a bull. Bull in Greek myth is related to Zeus. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On April 1, people in countries all over the world like to play pranks on other people. 
                    Depending on the culture, the victim of such a joke is known as a "fool" or a fish. It
                    is not clear when the tradition started and there are countless theories. April 1 is 
                    widely referred to as April Fools' Day.

                <p>
                   In 1932, Australia declared a war against emus (a large flightless bird), in a war known as 
                   the Great Emu War. It was to address a public concern over the number of emus (reportedly 
                   over a million) said to be running amok and destroying crops in the Campion district within 
                   the Wheatbelt of Western Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Interestingly, Australia lost the war. Even though no human was killed, compared to the 
                   thousands of emus killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop 
                   destruction and Australia had to give up on that approach.

            <h2>HEALTH AND LIFESTYLE</h2>
            <h3>ORAL HYGIENE</h3>
            <p>
                Taking care of our teeth entails proper washing of it. Brushing teeth is something we all have 
                been doing for plenty years now and may even take offense if we were told we just don't know how
                to do it efficiently. However, there is a proper way to brush our teeth and I bet not many of us 
                are doing it right.
            </p>
            <p>
               Dentists recommend that people brush their teeth twice a day (in the morning before breakfast and 
               at night after supper). In brushing your teeth, the first thing you should do is to floss. 
               Flossing helps to dislodge particles that may have been stuck between the teeth. After flossing, 
               rinse your mouth with a mouth wash thoroughly. In a case where you have no mouthwash, clean water 
               would suffice. The idea is to bring out particles that are hidden in the mouth or that may have 
               been dislodged during flossing. After rinsing, you can now brush your teeth with toothpaste and 
               a toothbrush. In brushing your teeth, move the brush gently in circles over the teeth and
               alternate with gentle strokes at an angle of 45 degrees. Be careful not to brush against your gum.
               Brush your tongue gently too so as not to remove too many necessary bacteria that live there.
               After brushing, do not rinse your mouth. Leaving the paste in mouth helps protect the teeth for 
               longer periods.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know this method of brushing contradicts the popular method we all may be used to - brush and 
                then rinse. But that is why I stated that many of us are not actually brushing our teeth the 
                right way - floss, rinse and brush. Anyway, now you know!
